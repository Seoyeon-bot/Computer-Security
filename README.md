# Computer-Security
Programming regarding techniques for privilege escalation, buffer overflows, race conditions, SQL injection, cross-site  scripting, packet  spoofing,TCP attacks ,and firewalls.

#Lab3 
• Environment variables
• Set-UID programs
• Securely invoke external programs • Capability leaking
• Dynamic loader/linker

#Lab4 - Buffer Overflow
• Buffer overflow vulnerability and attack\n
• Stack layout
• Address randomization, non-executable stack, and StackGuard
• Shellcode (32-bit and 64-bit)
• Thereturn-to-libcattack,which aims at defeating the non-executable stack counter measure,is covered
in a separate lab.

#Lab5 - Buffer Overflow & Return-to-libc attack & ROP
• Buffer overflow vulnerability
• Stack layout in a function invocation and Non-executable stack 
• Return-to-libc attack and Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)

#Lab6 - Race condition
• Race condition vulnerability 
• Sticky symlink protection
• Principle of least privilege

#Lab7 - CSRF attack
• Cross-Site Request Forgery attack
• CSRF countermeasures: Secret token and Same-site cookie 
• HTTP GET and POST requests
• JavaScript and Ajax

#Lab8 - XSS attack 
• Cross-Site Scripting attack
• XSS worm and self-propagation 
• Session cookies
• HTTP GET and POST requests 
• JavaScript and Ajax
• Content Security Policy (CSP)

#Lab9 - SQL Injection Attack Lab
• SQL statements: SELECT and UPDATE statements 
• SQL injection
• Prepared statement

#Lab10 - Packet Sniffing and Spoofing Lab
• How the sniffing and spoofing work
• Packet sniffing using the pcap library and Scapy 
• Packet spoofing using raw socket and Scapy
• Manipulating packets using Scapy
